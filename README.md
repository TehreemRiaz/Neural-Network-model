# Neural-Network-model
 Implementation of a Neural Network model in TensorFlow using its core functionality (i.e. without the help of a high level API like Keras).

Gradient descent algorithm with the help of TensorFlow's automatic differentiation is also implemented. While it’s easier to get started with TensorFlow with the Keras API, it’s still worth understanding how a slightly lower level implementation might work in Tensorﬂow.

Solving a multi-class classification probelm using the neural network implementation.
